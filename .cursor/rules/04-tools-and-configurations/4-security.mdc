Title: Security and Permissions

Scope: Secrets handling, permissions, and RBAC across the project.

Permissions:
- Workspace read access is limited via `volley-app-frontend/.claude/settings.local.json`.
- Do not widen permissions without explicit user approval.

Secrets:
- Never log or commit secrets/keys.
- Use environment variables; exclude from VCS.

Auth/RBAC:
- Follow existing authentication patterns (JWT/OAuth) and guards.
- Enforce role-based access consistently in backend modules.

Logging & Errors:
- Log in EN with error codes; translate user messages to FR.
- Avoid sensitive data in logs.
